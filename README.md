## Traffic-Congestion-Control

This repository contains code for three models designed to tackle traffic congestion:

**Model 1: Traffic Congestion Estimation**

This model calculates the actual level of traffic congestion using video data captured by drones. This data can be valuable for understanding traffic patterns and implementing congestion mitigation strategies.

**Model 2: Signal Optimization Evaluation**

This model measures the effectiveness of optimized traffic signal timing in improving traffic flow at intersections. It allows you to assess the impact of signal adjustments on congestion reduction.

**Model 3: Bottleneck Detection**

This model identifies bottlenecks that contribute to traffic congestion, such as:

* Parking violations
* Encroachment on roads and footpaths
* Deteriorated road conditions (potholes, bad road surfaces, faded markings)

By pinpointing these bottlenecks, the model provides insights for targeted interventions to improve traffic flow.
